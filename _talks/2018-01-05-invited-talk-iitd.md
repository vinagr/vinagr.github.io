<!-- Abstract
---
In this talk I will discuss two problems with an overarching theme of 'materials under extreme environments'. In the first part, we study the physics behind ferroelectric generators. Ferroelectric materials can be used to generate a large pulse of current or voltage when subjected to a shock loading. Using conservation laws and the second law of thermodynamics, we formulate the governing equations for large deformation dynamic behavior of these materials and derive the expression for driving force acting on the propagating shock. Using the derived governing equations, we solve a plate impact problem and validate the results with experiments. It is also seen that the characteristic behavior of these materials depend on the boundary conditions. Finally, we study the influence of material and geometrical parameters on the power output.

In the second part, we study the dynamic fragmentation of brittle materials using Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) formulation. This is particularly important in understanding processes like planetary impact, crater formation and satellite damage due to micrometeorite impact. This also finds application in rover designs for space missions to planetary entities such as Europa. We implement the CDM formulation on an existing computational framework that operates on an Eulerian grid. This allows us to deal with very large deformations without dealing with mesh entanglement issues. We use a thermodynamically consistent, Grady Kipp model as a starting point for damage evolution. We simulate the process of hypervelocity impact of an Aluminum impactor onto a basalt target and compare our results with existing literature. Finally we comment on damage formation and identify future areas of work. -->
