In the last few decades, cochlear implants have experienced major developments with intensive studies carried out through experimental and computational analysis. With the rapid increase in computational resources available and the development of efficient computational techniques, computer models of the cochlea and the cochlear implant have become more sophisticated. It is now possible to analyze the micromechanics of the cochlea and the transient response of tissue to external stimulation. This study reviews the major developments in cochlear models, summarizes, and categorizes features of models used in different studies and makes recommendations for future development. The paper is classified into four sections detailing features of the cochlear models, electrodes, electrical stimulation, and software used in different studies. The paper highlights unexplored areas in the model design and suggests additions to develop a better computer model.
