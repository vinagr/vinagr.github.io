Despite advances in manufacturing making metal functionally graded materials (FGMs) more common, numerical methods for predicting fracture in ductile functionally graded materials remain limited. In this work we study the crack propagation in ductile FGMs, specifically focusing on crack propagation within the gradient region of an FGM. We investigate the direct effects of plasticity, and the exact correlations between accumulated plastic strain and crack growth patterns in an FGM. Through this, we determine key differences in crack growth patterns between well-studied brittle FGMs, and more recently developed ductile FGMs. We provide substantial insight on the influence of both the angle of incidence and the width of the gradient, and expose potential pathways for engineering crack-arresting behavior in ductile FGMs
