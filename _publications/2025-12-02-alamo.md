Alamo is a high-performance scientific code that uses block-structured adaptive mesh refinement to solve such problems as the ignition and burn of solid rocket propellant, plasticity, damage and fracture in materials undergoing loading, and the interaction of compressible flow with eroding solid materials. Alamo is powered by AMReX, and provides a set of unique methods, models, and algorithms that enable it to solve solid-mechanics problems (coupled to other physical behavior such as fluid flow or thermal diffusion) using the power of block-structured adaptive mesh refinement.
