We study the problem of impact-induced shock wave propagation through a model one-dimensional heterogeneous medium. This medium is made of a model material with spatially varying parameters such that it is heterogeneous to shock waves but homogeneous to elastic waves. Using the jump conditions and maximal dissipation criteria, we obtain the exact solution to the shock propagation problem. We use it to study how the nature of the heterogeneity changes material response, the structure of the shock front and the dissipation.
