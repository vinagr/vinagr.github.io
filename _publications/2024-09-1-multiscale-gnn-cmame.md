title: "Multiscale graph neural networks with adaptive mesh refinement for accelerating mesh-based simulations"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-09-1-multiscale-gnn-cmame
excerpt: 'In this work, we develop a multiscale mesh-based GNN framework mimicking a conventional iterative multigrid solver, coupled with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), to mitigate challenges with conventional mesh-based GNNs. We use the framework to accelerate phase field (PF) fracture problems involving coupled partial differential equations with a near-singular operator due to near-zero modulus inside the crack.'
