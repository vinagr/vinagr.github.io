This course was taught every fall from 2018 to 2024. This is a first-year graduate level course that introduces linearized continuum mechanics and provides a glimpse of various topics in solid mechanics. 

Course description
===
Topics include
1. Tensor analysis
1. Linearized continuum mechanics (kinematics, conservation laws, constitutive equations)
1. Elastostatic solutions (Airy stress functions, Lame' solutions, fracture mechanics)
1. Elastodynamic solutions (method of characteristics, discontinuous waves, continuous waves)
1. Plasticity (J2 plasticity, Tresca criteria, Crystal Plasticity)
