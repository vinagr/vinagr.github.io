This course was taught every spring from 2018 to 2024. This is a senior-year undergraduate level course that introduces topics in vibrations of aerospace structures.

Course description
===
Topics include
1. Single degree of freedom problems (free and forced vibrations)
1. Two degree of freedom systems (synchronous motions, mode shapes, forced vibrations)
1. Virtual work and Extended Hamilton Principle
1. Continuous systems (boundary value problems, mode shapes and frequencies)
1. Vibrations of strings and beams (free and forced vibrations)
